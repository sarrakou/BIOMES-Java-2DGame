# BIOMES-Java-2DGame

This 2D game was developed using NetBeansIDE and Javadb. It is my first ever experience with a real gameplay environment, which was developed using JPanels.
This project was an academic project done by my classmate (Wael Khayati) and I (Sarra Koussaier).

## Installation

 At this point, this project is unfortunately not installable. You can however download the files in this repo and try the code yourselves using Netbeans.
